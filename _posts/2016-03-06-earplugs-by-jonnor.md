description: "Project homepage: https://github.com/jonnor/projects/tree/master/practical3d#ninjaflex-earplugs Inspired by modern \"HiFi\" in-ear hearing protection. Made out of NinjaFlex. The model could also adapted to make replacement earbuds for in-ear headphones. I don't have access to a commercial pair right now for comparisons (lost them), but from 1 hour of usage dampening level and comfort seems comparable."
