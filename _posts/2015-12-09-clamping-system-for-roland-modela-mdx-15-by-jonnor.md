description: 'Designed to be milled on the Modela itself, from 5-8 mm material, using ~2mm endmill. The roundclamp is 3d-printed. The base doubles as a sacrificial layer, and can be planed by the mill to ensure perfect flatness. Full worksize plates can be fixed with the sideclamps only, smaller pieces with the roundclamps or combination of side+roundclamp.'
